# Notary Load Tester

This repository contains a k6 script that is designed to load test the TLSN Demo React app. The script simulates user actions by clicking on the "Start Proof" button, records the total action time, and captures screenshots. 

To run the load test, make sure you have k6 installed on your system. Then run:

```
make test
```
